   12. I will be crontab-ing my pulls of your work directories, so from
       here on out the deadlines will be strictly enforced

       10. If you submit something at 9:01 PM, I will not see it

5. Reading 1 results

   13. Must include your take - a summary is not enough

   15. Some insights

       14. **Optimization**

           3. "*The real problem is that programmers have spent far too
              much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places
              and at the wrong times; *\ ***premature optimization is
              the root of all evil***\ \* (or at least most of it) in
              programming"\*. --Donald Knuth, Turing Award acceptance
              speech

       15. **Paralysis by analysis** - There are so many tools and so
           much info, how do you know what you should be doing, and when

           4. Don’t be afraid to just try things (git should make you
              braver)

           5. Collaboration is your friend

           6. Incorporate info in small, but constant chunks

       16. **You can overdo it with the comments**

           7. One school of thought even pushes for code that’s so
              self-descriptive, comments are unnecessary

       17. **Myth: People with CS backgrounds are uninterested in other
           fields**

           8. It is important for people in their fields to know the
              basics of CS so that interesting ideas and concepts can be
              effectively communicated to people with stronger CS
              backgrounds

6. More git basics

   16. Who’s been burned by git yet?

       18. commit early and often

       19. beware commands where you can truly lose work

           9.  reset --hard

           10. checkout --

   17. branching, merging (esp. merge conflicts)

   18. In-class demo: hello-world + branching example

   19. Interactive demo: pow function - merge conflict over github

7. Follow intro python `lecture
   notes <http://www.jarrodmillman.com/rcsds/standard/python.html#data-structures>`__
   up to control-flow and do exercises in groups.
