Lab 1

1. Intro to this lab

   1. In general the structure of today’s lab will be different from the
      labs in general

   2. Today is about getting everybody on the same page for getting
      started with class on Tuesday (no fMRI stuff today!)

      1. If you’re already running linux (or very familiar with \*nix
         systems), have an editor, have set up git and a github account,
         this may seem a little tedious, but I’ll try to give you
         something to do

2. Laptop check

3. First things first - get installs and tools all set up for Tuesday

   3. First: Piazza

   4. Github

      2. Who doesn’t have a github account yet?

      3. Google form with two entries: student name and github names

   5. OS Poll

      4. Have students who didn’t take it yet fill it out

      5. Show results

   6. Why \*nix?

      6. Full control of the computer

      7. CLI is arguable faster (with some training)

         1. More importantly: reproducible!

      8. Most servers run linux

      9. Almost all supercomputers

   7. Discuss options for linux

      10. BCE

      11. Other VM

      12. Dual boot

      13. Account on a server - contact home department about setting up

4. Next - Brief discussion of text editors

   8.  ADVANCED: For students that are past this point and using vim,
       check out pathogen vim system - goal: install simple-vim package

       14. google vim-awesome to explore vim plugins

   9.  Graphics based vs. non graphics based:

       15. Programmers in general should be familiar with non-graphics
           based editors because chances are you will be forced into a
           non-graphics enabled environment at some point

           2. Recovery

           3. ssh

       16. GUI-based editors:

           4. Simple ones like Gedit, gvim

           5. IDE’s like eclipse

       17. Recommended pathway - get familiar with a non-graphics
           editor, then switch into an IDE for specific tasks (this
           pathway is so common, that most IDE’s have key-bindings for
           the non-graphics based editors like vim)

   10. Vim - steep learning curve (although 30 min is enough to get you
       started)

       18. vimtutor

   11. emacs - the other of the "big 2"

5. Install git

   12. Who hasn’t installed git?

       19. Help with installs

       20. ADVANCED: For bored students, check out the "hub" project
           from github

   13. Configure git

       21. Use git config with --global flag

       22. show the .gitconfig file that gets created

6. Next, go through the course intro

   14. http://www.jarrodmillman.com/rcsds/lectures/day01.html

   15. Quiz on Thursday based on "interactive shell" and “basic file
       management” sections

7. Do the tutorial in tutorial-unix-basics

   16. First, clone the tutorial:
       https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-unix-basics.git

   17. You’ll also need another repo which serves as an example
       directory structure to explore/change/move files:
       https://github.com/berkeley-stat243/stat243-fall-2014

   18. Split into groups (or solo + screencast) and follow the tutorial
