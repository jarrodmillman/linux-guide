   the `project overview <http://www.jarrodmillman.com/stat159-fall2015/project/README.pdf>`_
#. Sign up on `Piazza <https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2015/stat159/home>`_
#. If you don't already have one, create a GitHub account `here <https://github.com/join>`_.
#. Install BCE on your laptop: http://bce.berkeley.edu/install
#. Read the "Basics of UNIX" tutorial and watch the accompanying screencast

Definitions
-----------

A **graph** is an ordered pair :math:`G = (V, E)` of a set :math:`V` of nodes
(or vertices) and either an ordered pair :math:`(a,b)` or an unordered pair
:math:`\{a,b\}` of edges between nodes of :math:`V`.

A **directed graph** has directed edges each represented by an ordered pair
:math:`(a,b)` of nodes.  An **undirected graph** has undirected edges each
represented by an unordered pair :math:`\{a,b\}` of nodes.

A **path** is a sequence of edges which connect a sequence of distinct
(excluding the first and last) nodes.  Paths are ordered (unordered) for
directed (undirected) graphs.  A path with the same first and last node
is a **cycle**.

A **tree** is a graph with at most one path between any two
nodes.

A **directed acylic graph (DAG)** is a directed graph with no cycles.

Is it worth the time?

Text editor
~~~~~~~~~~~

You will be using a text editor extensively in this class.  Unlike many
aspects of computing, your choice of text editor will have little direct
impact on people you work with or who use your code.  However, choosing
a good text editor is extremely important if you wish to
efficiently and effectively work on a computer.

Please read this carefully:
