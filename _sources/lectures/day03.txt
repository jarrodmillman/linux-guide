   here: http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials
#. `The Interactive Shell <http://www.jarrodmillman.com/rcsds/standard/bash.html#the-interactive-shell>`_ and

We will start discussing Python next Thursday.  If you haven't ever used Python
I encourage you to look over `The Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/>`_
before Thursday, September 10th.  In particular, look through:

#. Whetting Your Appetite
