Announcements
-------------

- Presentations will be 5 minutes per group on Thursday, November 12 (i.e., 2 weeks from today)
- Draft reports (~6 pages) due on Thursday, November 12 at 21:00
- BIC tour on Monday, November 23 (during lab time)

Task
----

(Remember to always add new code and text via pull-requests.)

I will check that each group completed the work from Tuesday:

- Add TravisCI and Coveralls.io buttons to your README.md
- Make sure your tests pass, add a new test

Here is what you should work on today:

- Make a tentative roadmap for what you want to do in the next 2 weeks
  including who is assigned to each part
- Make sure you have merged at least one pull request today
- Don't forget that a pull request needs to be reviewed by at least
  one person not involved in writing the code or text
- Each team should have someone look into:

  - slides/progress.md
  - paper/report.tex, paper/report.bib

  In particular, one member of the team should create a pull request
  to modify `slides/progress.md` (e.g., put your title, team member
  names, etc.).  Another member of the team should create a pull request
  to modify `paper/report.tex` and `paper/report.bib` (e.g., put
  your title, team member names, references to your paper and data, etc.).
  A third (or possibly fourth) member should review changes, possibly
  make suggestions, and then merge the pull request once it is ready.

Remember
--------

- If you have questions about your projects, there should be a pull request with code
  or text and use `@jarrodmillman`, `@matthew-brett`, and/or `@rossbar`
- Most of your code should be written as a collection of functions
  with tests, then use scripts calling these functions to perform
  your analysis
