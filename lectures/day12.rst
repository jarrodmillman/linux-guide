Lesson plan
-----------

* An outline of where we're going:

  * we have done "activation" by subtracting task from rest;
  * we have done activation by correlation with on-off time-course;
  * a more sophisticated regressor using convolution;
  * activation by multiple regression

* Review of `correlation each voxel solutions
  <https://github.com/jarrodmillman/rcsds/blob/master/lectures/correlation_each_voxel.ipynb>`_
* reshaping 4D to 2D and back again: :doc:`reshaping_arrays`;
* reshaping exercise: :doc:`correlation_2d`;
* introduction to testing with nose;
* exercise: correlation one to many;
* the neural and hemodynamic model;
* convolution;
* exercise: convolve and correlate.

Homework
--------

We will post some videos on collaboration with git later today (Tuesday 6th).
