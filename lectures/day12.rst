Lesson plan
-----------

* An outline of where we're going:

  * we have tried to find "activation" by subtracting task from rest;
  * we have used correlation with the on-off time-course;
  * we will try a more sophisticated regressor using convolution;
  * then, detection of activation by multiple regression.

* Review of `correlation each voxel solutions
  <https://github.com/jarrodmillman/rcsds/blob/master/lectures/correlation_each_voxel.ipynb>`_
* reshaping 4D to 2D and back again: :doc:`reshaping_arrays`;
* reshaping exercise: :doc:`correlation_2d`;
* about :doc:`dot_products`;
* :doc:`revision about correlation <on_correlation>`;
* introduction to :doc:`nose_intro`;
* a reminder about ``np.tile``;
* exercise: open the files :download:`pearson.py <../_downloads/pearson.py>` and
  :download:`test_pearson_1d.py <../_downloads/test_pearson_1d.py>` and 
  :download:`test_pearson_2d.py <../_downloads/test_pearson_2d.py>` . 
  Read the instructions in both these files, and, shoot at will;
* the neural and hemodynamic model;
* convolution;
