Lesson plan
-----------

* An outline of where we're going:

  * we have done "activation" by subtracting task from rest;
  * we have done activation by correlation with on-off time-course;
  * a more sophisticated regressor using convolution;
  * activation by multiple regression

* Reshaping 4D to 2D and back again: :doc:`reshaping_arrays`;
* exercise: correlation via reshaping;
* introduction to testing with nose;
* exercise: correlation one to many;
* the neural and hemodynamic model;
* convolution;
* exercise: convolve and correlate.

Homework
--------

We will post some videos on collaboration with git later today (Tuesday 6th).
