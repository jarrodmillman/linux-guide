Comments
--------

Please carefully review the
`tentative final project grading rubric <http://www.jarrodmillman.com/rcsds/notes/rubric.pdf>`_

Basically I will be looking for projects that involve (among other things):

- constant improvement (e.g., work every week)
- team effort 
- clear reasoning that is carefully and comprehensively documented
- questions that are motivated and well formulated
- methods that are appropriate for those questions
- code that is modular, readable, comprehensively tested, and well organized
- results that are relevant and directly related to the methods
- conclusions that justified by the work (i.e., they should be limited and specific)

Moreover, everything you do **must** be reproducible.  I will need to be able to issue
a few commands to download all the relevant data, that runs your analysis, and that
generates all your plots, tables, and other results.

Remember
--------

- If you have questions about your projects, there should be a pull request with code
  or text and use `@jarrodmillman`, `@matthew-brett`, `@rossbar`, 
  and\or `@jbpoline`
- Most of your code should be written as a collection of functions
  with tests, then use scripts calling these functions to perform
  your analysis
