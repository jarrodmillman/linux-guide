Lesson plan
-----------

* Revision of nibabel load, ``get_data``;
* Images with three and four dimensions;
* Summary functions work on all dimensions unless you tell them otherwise; use
  ``axis=`` to tell them otherwise;

We will go over the :doc:`OpenFMRI notes <openfmri_notes>`.

We will then download and extract a dataset in class, and explain the
directory structure and how to read the data.

* Brain cartoons, and the frontal lobe;
* Block designs and event-related designs;
* Repetition time (TR) is the time between the beginning of acquisition of one
  volume and the beginning of the next;
* Negating booleans with ``~bool_arr``
* ``np.loadtxt`` loads text files into numpy arrays;
