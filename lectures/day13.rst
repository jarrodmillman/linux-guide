Lesson plan
-----------

* An outline of where we're going:

  * we have tried to find "activation" by subtracting task from rest;
  * we have used correlation with the on-off time-course;
  * we will try a more sophisticated regressor using convolution;
  * then, detection of activation by multiple regression.

* Collaborative git workflow;

    * Review of :download:`pearson_solutions.py`.

* Using ``pearson.py`` and array reshaping;
* A better regressor using convolution;
