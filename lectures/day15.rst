Lesson plan
-----------

* An outline of where we're going:

  * we have tried to find "activation" by subtracting task from rest;
  * we have used correlation with the on-off time-course;
  * we will try a more sophisticated regressor using convolution;
  * then, detection of activation by multiple regression.


* On :doc:`matrix_rank`;
* :doc:`test_one_voxel`;
* Comparing to R with :download:`model_one_voxel.R`;
* :doc:`matrix multiplying more than one column <multi_multiply>`;
* Exercise |--| :doc:`multi_model`.
* Extending the model with linear and quadratic drift;
* Experimental design;
* Brain question time.
