Background
==========

These notes assume you've taken a semester of undergraduate linear algebra.
In particular, I assume you are familiar with the following:

- solving systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination
- linear combinations of vectors to produce a space
- the rank of a matrix

I will review some of the above topics, but if you haven't seen them before
the presentation may be difficult to follow.
