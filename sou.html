<h1>Word Vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#word-vectors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In many statistical applications, data are represented as vectors in
some space. For instance, in genomic applications measurements for gene
expression levels may be recorded for several subjects. Each of these
subjects is then represented as a vector in gene space where each
dimension represents the expression level of a specific gene.</p>
<p>In other applications, the data is not directly presented as a vector
space model; yet may be usefully represented as such. For this part of
the assignment, you will see one common way to represent text documents
as vectors. Once we&#8217;ve represented text documents as vectors we will
want to ask which documents are similar to each other. We could use the
dot product or cosine of the angle between two document vectors as our
measure of similarity; however, in the second homework you will use
another distance measure that has proved fruitful for measuring
similarity in text documents.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-bag-of-words-and-a-term-document-matrix">
<h2>A bag of words and a term-document matrix<a class="headerlink" href="#a-bag-of-words-and-a-term-document-matrix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Natural languages encode part of the meaning of a text in the specific
order of the words as the following two sentences illustrate:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>John ate the tomato.
The tomato ate John.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For some tasks, however, it suffices to consider only the number of
occurrences of each word in a document&#8212;disregarding grammar and word
order. Such a simplified representation of a document is called a <em>bag
of words</em> model.</p>
<p>To get a sense of why this simple model might be useful consider the
task of distinguishing documents pertaining to cars from documents about
flowers. In documents related to cars you might expect to see many
occurrences of words like power, drive, wheel, etc. Similarly, in the
documents about flowers you might expect to see many occurrences of
words like petal, bud, seed, etc.</p>
<p>To see how we could use this insight in practice, consider the following
three simple text documents (i.e., consider each sentence a separate
document):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>R is a popular programming language for statistical computing.
The Python programming language is also popular for statistical programming.
Spanish is a popular foreign language taught in US schools.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Based on these three documents, we can create the following list of
words used in our collection of documents (let&#8217;s call this our
vocabulary):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;also&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;computing&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;for&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;foreign&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;in&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;is&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;language&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;popular&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;programming&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;python&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;r&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;schools&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;spanish&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;statistical&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;taught&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;the&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="s">&#39;us&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For each word in the above list of 18 words, we can count how many times
it occurs in the first text document to create the word vector</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where each element of the word vector is the number of times the
corresponding word from our list of vocabulary words appears in the
first document. For example, the first <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></code> in the above word vector
represents the fact that the word <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span></code> appears exactly once in the
sentence
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">popular</span> <span class="pre">programming</span> <span class="pre">language</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">statistical</span> <span class="pre">computing.</span></code>
Similarly, the first <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></code> represents the fact that the word <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">also</span></code>
does not occur in the sentence.</p>
<p>Following the same procedure for the second and third sentences in our
collection of documents, yields the following two word vectors:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<p>Putting the list of vocabulary words used in our collection of documents
as well as the word vector for each document under the bag of words
model, we can form the following term document matrix:</p>

<p>where each row of the matrix corresponds to the given term from our
vocabulary and each column represents one document from our collection.</p>
<p>One purpose of representing the collection of documents as a matrix of
word vector columns is that we can measure the &#8220;distance&#8221; between any
two column vectors in our term document matrix to get a sense of how
similar the corresponding documents are.</p>
<p>The dot-product between word vectors is a simple approach to measuring
the similarity of the corresponding documents. We will see better
alternatives to this measure later, but for now let&#8217;s just consider this
simple &#8220;distance&#8221; measure. Recall that the dot-product
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\)</span> between two vectors
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> is the sum of products of the
corresponding elements
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum{a_i b_i}\)</span>. Taking the
dot-product of all pairs of word vectors yields the following similarity
matrix:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>              Document 1     Document 2    Document 3
Document 1        9              4             7
Document 2        4             10             3
Document 3        7              3            12
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As you would expect, each document is most similar with itself. However,
does it make sense to think document 3 is more similar to itself than
document 2 is similar to itself? Probably not. The reason that document
3 has a higher entry in the similarity matrix based on raw word
occurrence counts and the dot-product is that we aren&#8217;t controlling for
the length of the document. However, notice that documents 1 and 3 are
more similar (by this measure) than either documents 1 and 2 or
documents 2 and 3. Since the first and third documents are both related
to statistical programming languages, you would hope that our approach
results in a similarity measure that results in them being closer to
each other than either is to the document about natural language.
Fortunately, even with this simple approach the results aren&#8217;t too far
off from what you might expect.</p>
