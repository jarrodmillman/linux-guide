<h2>Making Collaboration and Git Easier<a class="headerlink" href="#making-collaboration-and-git-easier" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many of you identified git and, more generally, collaborating as one of the
primary challenges for your projects. In light of that feedback, I wanted to
cover a few git topics. First, several groups mentioned that they were using
facebook chat to communicate or were otherwise having trouble getting everyone
in the same room at one time. There are a couple tools you should be aware of
that could help with the general communication issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is a popular messaging/organization app for
team-based projects. If you are having trouble getting everyone on the same
chat (not everyone uses facebook) or your schedules are such that it&#8217;s very
challenging to meet in person as often as you&#8217;d like to, you may want to
investigate this tool</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/">Gitter</a> is another popular messaging app for
github-based projects. One of the things that&#8217;s really nice about it
is it integrates with GitHub (for instance you can add a button to your
README.md to link to your gitter page, just like you do for TravisCI and
coverage). Again, if you&#8217;re having trouble with real-time communication as
a group, this might be a tool worth investigating.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, on to things specific to git. Let&#8217;s start with a few quick and easy things
to make life easier:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>git_ps1: Info about your repos in the bash prompt</li>
<li>git alias: just like bash alias - can make &#8220;shortcuts&#8221; for commands you
might use frequently, e.g.<ul>
<li>git unstage</li>
<li>git hist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rossbar/UbuntuInstallScripts">scripts</a> I use to
configure my Linux environment contain specific examples for these two topics,
specifically the bash_color and configure_git scripts.</p>
<p>GitHub is loaded with scripts that people use to configure their computing
environment, so if you don&#8217;t like these ones, feel free to try to find others
by searching GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Undoing things in git &#8211; git reset</strong></p>
<p>Many people have had questions both in lab and office hours relating to how do
you <em>undo</em> things in git. There is a
<a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things">whole section</a> on
this topic in the pro git book.</p>
<p>As an aside, if you are planning on continuing computational work and using git,
I very strongly recommend you take the time to read the
<a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">pro git</a> book. It&#8217;s free online, and is where
I learned 90% of the things that I know about git.</p>
<p>Back to undoing things... Let&#8217;s follow along with a section in the pro git book:
<a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Reset-Demystified">reset demystified</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="python-packages-you-ve-expressed-interest-in">
<h2>Python Packages you&#8217;ve Expressed Interest In<a class="headerlink" href="#python-packages-you-ve-expressed-interest-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From the feedback in your presentations, there were a couple packages that
teams expressed interest in and I figured I&#8217;d just touch on them here. First:</p>
<p><strong>Pandas</strong></p>
<p>Pandas is a library that intends to make working with data easier. At it&#8217;s core,
it&#8217;s really nothing more than a high-level wrapper over numpy arrays. That&#8217;s not
to say it isn&#8217;t useful however! I&#8217;ve only used pandas sparingly as I prefer to
work with numpy arrays directly, but from my experience, one of the biggest
advantages of using pandas is it&#8217;s ability to deal with imperfect, typed data
with relative ease. For example, if you have multi-field data where each value
in a row has a specific meaning (for example, col1 = timestamp, col2 = stock
price, col3 = purchases/hour), the pandas <em>dataframe</em> object handles this data
well. Of course, you can deal with data like this in numpy as well with
np.dtype, but the real advantage of pandas comes in the ability to add fields
(for example, say you wanted to add a col4 that represented the temperature)
and for dealing with missing or irregular data.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you&#8217;re much better off using pure numpy arrays for dealing with
the fMRI data as it is strictly numerical in nature.</p>
<p><strong>scikit-learn</strong></p>
<p>Many groups have asked about/started using scikit-learn. The scikit-learn
library has many, many tools for both supervised and unsupervised learning,
including a ton of built-in tools for regression and classification.</p>
<p>For your projects, you may be interested in some of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html">regression tools</a>.
Let&#8217;s get your feet wet with a super simple exercise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scikit-learn-exercise">
<h2>scikit-learn exercise<a class="headerlink" href="#scikit-learn-exercise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Load the &#8220;digits&#8221; dataset that comes with scikit learn</li>
<li>Use imshow to visualize a couple of images from the digits dataset. Can you
tell what numbers they represent? (use the &#8220;target&#8221; array to check your
answer).</li>
<li>Use the train_test_split() helper function from sklearn to split the digits
dataset into a training and test set. Use 2/3 of the dataset to train on.</li>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve trained your classifier, use it&#8217;s .predict() method to look at a
couple specific examples in your test set.</li>
<li>Use the .score() method of your classifier to see how well it performs on the
entire test set.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In all, this example should take very few lines of code, but your classifier
may not be very good. At this point, if you are interested, you can continue
following through scikit-learn examples to improve your classifier. For
instance, you may be interested in using sklearn&#8217;s cross-validation tools to
determine optimal parameters for you classifier, or perhaps try a different
classifier.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-work">
<h2>Project work<a class="headerlink" href="#project-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As for your presentations, several groups seemed to have a good start on
preprocessing their data, but with the exception of a couple of groups, there
was very little in the way of preliminary analysis. We will have more specific
feedback Tuesday in class, but the general theme is: get going with your
analyses!</p>
