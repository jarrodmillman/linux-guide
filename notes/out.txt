Statistics 150/259 final project grading rubric
===============================================

You should include figures and text in the body of your report.  Your text
should be organized into appropriate sections.  Your figures must be labeled,
captioned, and referred to in your text.  Leave all code snippets, including
variable names, out of the main body or the report; however, you will be
expected to include all relevant code in your project repository.  The code
is part of your report and you should spend significant time making sure that
it is readable, correct, and clear. While you should not directly refer to
the code in the report, you will need to describe your analysis fully in the
text. For example, while you should not mention what type of looping structure
or variable names you used for an analysis step, you must include enough detail
such that someone reading your text should be able to write his or her own program
to reproduce your results.

Below is the grading rubric I will be using to assess your submissions. To
receive the equivalent of an "A" on this assignment you will need to have
roughly seven check marks and two check pluses.
